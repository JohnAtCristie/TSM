TSM
===

My collection of scripts for making my life as TSM consultant easier. You are free to use and modify my scritps as you wish, *but please remember that you run them on your own risk* as always when you copy and paste stuff form the Internets.
I am a Linux technician but many of the scripts here are for Windows, so I gladly accept any enhancements of my batch scritps.
If you use any of the scripts in my TSM collection you are welcome to provide feedback on the system you are using it on and if the operation was successful - with or without changes - so I can update the list with supported Windows/TSM version. 

- BAClientSchedConfig.cmd
	- Create the services necessary for BA Client. TSM Client Scheduler, TSM Client Acceptor
	- Tested on Windows8.1 
	
- TDPversion.cmd
	- Pre-alfa version of script to determine which version of DP for MSSQL to install. Should probably be Powerhell instead in *the future*
